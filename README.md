# Unit 1: Bare-Metal IPC & Custom Protocol Design

Welcome to **Unit 1** of COSC 3657 (Distributed Systems). In this project, you adopt the mindset of a **System Programmer** to construct a concurrent, networked key-value and task-queue server from first principles.

Instead of relying on high-level HTTP/gRPC frameworks that abstract away the network layer, you will work directly with POSIX TCP socket primitives, design a custom length-prefixed stream framing protocol, implement thread-safe storage using explicit synchronization locks, and build a worker thread pool to handle concurrent client operations safely.

**The spec is based on using Python as the implementation language but please feel free to choose the language of your preference.**

## 📚 Textbook Theoretical Alignment (CDK5 Mapping)

This project directly translates theoretical concepts from *Distributed Systems: Concepts and Design (5th Edition)* (Coulouris, Dollimore, Kindberg, and Blair) into working system code.

## 🛠️ Architecture & Protocol Specification

TCP provides a reliable stream of ordered bytes but does **not** preserve application message boundaries. To prevent **stream fragmentation** (where messages merge or split across buffer reads), all communication over port `9090` must conform to the following explicit framing protocol:

```text
+------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+
| 4-Byte Big-Endian Header           | Variable-Length Payload                   |
| (Unsigned 32-bit Integer Length N) | (UTF-8 Encoded JSON String, N Bytes)      |
+------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+
| 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x1F                | {"action": "PUT", "key": "k", ...}        |
+------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+

```

1. **Header Field:** A 4-byte unsigned integer in Network Byte Order (Big-Endian, struct format `!I`) denoting payload size $N$ in bytes.


2. **Payload Field:** An $N$-byte string containing a valid JSON object specifying an operational action (`PUT`, `GET`, `ENQUEUE`, `DEQUEUE`).

## 🚀 Quick Start (Dev Container / Codespaces)

This project is pre-configured to run inside a standardized Debian Linux environment using **VS Code Dev Containers** or **GitHub Codespaces**, guaranteeing identical functionality across Windows, macOS, and Linux.

### Option A: Local VS Code with Docker

1. Open Docker Desktop or OrbStack on your computer.
2. Open this directory in VS Code: `code .`
3. When prompted, click **"Reopen in Container"** (or press `F1` $\rightarrow$ `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`).

### Option B: Cloud Execution with GitHub Codespaces

1. Push this repository to GitHub.
2. Click **Code** $\rightarrow$ **Codespaces** $\rightarrow$ **Create codespace on main**.

## 🧪 Step-by-Step Testing & Verification Instructions

### 1. Start the Concurrent IPC Server

Inside the Dev Container terminal, start the multi-threaded server listening on all network interfaces (`0.0.0.0:9090`):

```bash
python server.py

```

*Expected Output:*

```text
[*] Server initialized on 0.0.0.0:9090
[*] Thread Pool initialized with max_workers=10...

```

### 2. Verify Port Binding

Open a secondary terminal split (`Ctrl+Shift+\``) and verify that port `9090`is in a`LISTEN` state:

```bash
lsof -i :9090

```

*Expected Output:*

```text
COMMAND   PID   USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
python3  1234 vscode    3u  IPv4  23456      0t0  TCP *:9090 (LISTEN)

```

### 3. Run the Concurrent Client Stress Harness

In the secondary terminal, execute the 20-thread concurrent stress tester to verify that thread synchronization locks and message framing hold up under concurrent load:

```bash
python client_stress_test.py

```

*Expected Output:*

```text
[*] Launching 20 concurrent client worker threads...
[Worker Thread 00] Transaction verified successfully.
[Worker Thread 01] Transaction verified successfully.
...
[Worker Thread 19] Transaction verified successfully.
[+] All 20 workers completed execution in 0.082 seconds.

```
